# Dominion
This project is a programmed version of the card game Dominion:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)

This is my current project I'm working on.  Here is the progress I've made on it so far:

Command line Python script:
Printing to command line clear and relevant information
Ability to buy cards
Card description dictionary
  *Still need to add action card implementation to this dictionary
